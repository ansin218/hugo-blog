      <description>When I was a kid, having the famous German black forest cake for my birthday was the norm. After I moved to Munich, Germany, I was only looking for this cake everywhere. However, I could not find it and settled for this thing called Donauwelle. It translates to Danube wave; Danube is a river flowing through different parts of Europe. It has been five years since I had Donauwelle for the first time and it is my favourite cake now; more than the black forest cake.</description>
