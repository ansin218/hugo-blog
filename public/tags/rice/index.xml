      <description>The Iranian zereshk polo recipe reminds me of the recipes of Biryani and Pulao from countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This does not come as a surprise because these regions were heavily under the Persian influence in the past. Unlike many parts of the world where rice is deliberately sticky or overcooked, Iranians want their rice to be rather separated when served. As an Indian, I can testify how tricky this can be as I have myself made Biryani and Pulao many times and it disappoints me if the rice ends up being overcooked.</description>
