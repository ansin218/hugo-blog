      <description>I baked this cake for my friend on the occassion of her birthday. Given that the birthday fell on a weekday and I was running short of helping hands as well as time, I must admit the effort to make this cake was not much although the result in terms of the taste and aesthetics were pretty decent to celebrate a special occassion. You can give this recipe a shot if you are on a similar boat, or even otherwise.</description>

      <description>My grandfather always tells me there is something to learn from everyone we will come across in our lives. Little did I know that there would be two wonderful ladies, a Turkish and a Kazakh, in my life who would teach me how to bake. They taught me when I was their flatmate in the student dorm in Munich. Strangely, until before this cake, I baked for many people except these two.</description>
