      <description>Vilnius was one of the places which I did not research much before travelling. I just went there trusting the recommendations of my colleagues who hail from the city and another close friend of mine. However, the morning after I arrived in Vilnius, I was trying to plan my day out as to which places I&amp;rsquo;d visit after the guided walking tour, and I came across this place, UÅ¾upis. The pictures on the internet did not tell me much.</description>

      <description>I baked this cake for my friend on the occassion of her birthday. Given that the birthday fell on a weekday and I was running short of helping hands as well as time, I must admit the effort to make this cake was not much although the result in terms of the taste and aesthetics were pretty decent to celebrate a special occassion. You can give this recipe a shot if you are on a similar boat, or even otherwise.</description>

      <description>My grandfather always tells me there is something to learn from everyone we will come across in our lives. Little did I know that there would be two wonderful ladies, a Turkish and a Kazakh, in my life who would teach me how to bake. They taught me when I was their flatmate in the student dorm in Munich. Strangely, until before this cake, I baked for many people except these two.</description>

      <description>If anyone knows me really well, they can assure you my love for Chinese food, especially the noodles with sauce made in Sichuan style. Be it restaurants or other friends, I pounce on the opportunity to ask for Sichuan food if given the option. After eating a lot of times at my friend&amp;rsquo;s place and other restaurants, and watching many videos from other Chinese people on the internet, I tried to replicate one of my favorite Sichuan dishes - the dandan noodles as it is popularly known.</description>

      <description>When I was a kid, having the famous German black forest cake for my birthday was the norm. After I moved to Munich, Germany, I was only looking for this cake everywhere. However, I could not find it and settled for this thing called Donauwelle. It translates to Danube wave; Danube is a river flowing through different parts of Europe. It has been five years since I had Donauwelle for the first time and it is my favourite cake now; more than the black forest cake.</description>

      <description>There are two kinds of people I have come across when it comes to adding extra oil to their food: the olive oil people and the chinese chilli oil people. I fall under the latter category. I love to add this to my soup, noodles, rice, pizza, or any other crazy things you can imagine. Having been using the one from my Chinese friend always, one fine day, I decided to make some for myself.</description>

      <guid>https://ankuroh.com/recipes/middle-eastern/zereshk-polo-recipe/</guid>
      <description>The Iranian zereshk polo recipe reminds me of the recipes of Biryani and Pulao from countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This does not come as a surprise because these regions were heavily under the Persian influence in the past. Unlike many parts of the world where rice is deliberately sticky or overcooked, Iranians want their rice to be rather separated when served. As an Indian, I can testify how tricky this can be as I have myself made Biryani and Pulao many times and it disappoints me if the rice ends up being overcooked.</description>

      <description>One Friday afternoon I was craving for some cake to have with my tea and decided to make this. I decided to improve this on the fly by adding some cardamom powder with some toppings of almonds and pistachios. So, here is a simple cardamom cake recipe with toppings of almonds and pistachios prepared in less than 10 minutes and baked in 30 minutes.

      <description>I baked this cake and my friend, Sukanya took charge of the decoration. We baked this for another friend of ours, Phyllis. We followed a mix of different recipes and fine tuned it to our requirements; especially the sweetness level because we do not boast of a great sweet tooth. You can also adjust the recipe below to get rid of the lemon part completely or increase the strength if you like the taste of it like I do.</description>

      <description>I love Turkish breakfast and brunches. One of the dishes my Turkish friends introduced to me was Cilbir (ÃÄ±lbÄ±r in Turkish). I made this for the first time when I was stuck in Munich under lockdown due to COVID-19 and was craving for some Turkish dish. It turned out to be really good; worthy of sharing it on my blog too. Cilbir can easily be made with ingredients that we already have at home or available at the supermarket.</description>

      <description>I always had a fascination to visit the Shaolin Temple in China. One day, while browsing through martial arts camps across the world, I stumbled upon one such training camp for Muay Thai Kickboxing in Bangkok, Thailand. When I was planning my trip to Hanoi, Saigon and Siem Reap, my friend and I thought about making a short stopover in Bangkok just to attend the camp. Both of us have never tried any form of martial arts before.</description>

      <description>One may visit Siem Reap for Angkor Wat alone but with the Cambodian government having a rule that one needs to spend at least a night before exiting the country, some travelers may wonder what can Siem Reap offer beyond Angkor Wat. While Angkor Wat alone can take more than a day if you want to dive deep, there are other things to do in Siem Reap beyond Angkor Wat too.</description>

      <description>Chu Chi Tunnels is easily one of the most fascinating places I have ever visited. Located about 60 km north west of Saigon, this place should be included in your itinerary if you happen to visit Saigon. I went on a tour of Chu Chi tunnels; you can book this tour via GetYourGuide for about 12 Euros only. The tour last for about 5-6 hours including the travel time. My guide, Mr.</description>

      <description>There are multiple options to venture out of Hanoi. I ruled out Halong Bay because it seems to be a bit too touristic, rushed and dirty, if you want to accomplish it in one day. I left Halong Bay for another time as I wanted to have a relaxed cruise trip instead. Sa Pa was another option but I had limited time as it is quite difficult to do it in one day; usually the trips last more than a day at least.</description>

      <description>I was in Bangkok for a Thai kickboxing camp. At the camp, we had a lady who was responsible for cooking for all of us. I approached her if I can learn how to make some Thai dishes from her and managed to get the recipe of Pad Thai as well. This is one of my favorite dishes as it beautifully combines the taste of salty, spicy, sweet and sour.</description>

      <description>I sat down on the floor wincing and gasping for breath after an intense session training for kickboxing. Just then, I noticed a lady with a bag of fresh herbs walking towards the kitchen. Despite the excruciating pain, I got back on my feet immediately and followed her.
I knocked on the door and politely asked, âHello! Are you going to cook something?â
In a strong Thai accent, she responded, âYes, maybe after fifteen minutes.</description>

      <description>There are three ways to get the Cambodian visa: online, on arrival or by visiting your nearest Cambodian embassy/consulate. I chose the first option for multiple reasons: not wasting further pages on my passport as I have only a few to spare, I did not want to step out of home to go to the consulate or stand in a long queue after reaching Cambodia to apply for my visa on arrival.</description>

      <description>Think of it for a moment
We are all jugglers, aren&amp;rsquo;t we?
Always juggling problems throughout life
With no option at all to break free
There&amp;rsquo;s someone out there somewhere
Crippled with a massive debt
There&amp;rsquo;s someone else also somewhere
Reeling through the H1B visa bet
There&amp;rsquo;s someone out there somewhere
Recovering from a painful breakup
There&amp;rsquo;s someone out there somewhere
Struggling to assemble things for his startup
There&amp;rsquo;s someone out there with a smiling face</description>

      <description>Tiramisu is my favorite Italian dessert. It is made with spoon biscuits known as savoiardi; really soft and has coffee flavored taste to it. I have had it multiple times in Italy and still continue to have it in Germany whenever I can. The crux of this Tiramisu recipe is from one of my Italian friends; a few other tiny modifications are from my side. Here is my attempt at surprising by making Tiramisu for some of my friends.</description>

Give me a chance to protect you like a soldier.
Give me a chance to cook for you when hungry.
Give me a chance to calm you down when angry.</description>

      <description>I finally reached Paris
I was missing someone dearly
I craved to hold her hands
And adore the 320 meter tall beauty
The city of love as it is popularly called
A few men knelt down on the ground
Expressing feelings to their lady love
Such was the scene all around
A few couples approched me
Requesting me to take their picture
The man passionately smooched his lady
I was their exclusive photographer</description>

      <description>Over an old rickety bridge
Where a canal connects with the sea
Stands a man in Venice
Who is dumbstruck by its beauty
Vintage buildings lined on the streets
Fresh flowers present everywhere
People waiting to board the boats
Aimlessly going here and there
Young couples making love
Old couples walking holding hands
The aroma of the Italian food
Along with performances by local bands
In midst of all these</description>

      <description>I happened to Google about what to do in Dublin and stumbled upon this link from the Irish Whiskey Museum. My friend being from Canada had some knowledge about this domain but I had zero. However, this visit to the Irish Whiskey Museum was completely worth it and I would strongly recommend it even if you are a newbie like me.
My friend and I booked the Early Bird Premium Tour which cost us around â¬19.</description>

      <description>If you ever had beer in your life, chances are high that you have heard of Guinness and/or tried it as well. Whether you are a fan of Guinness or not is another matter but the Guinness factory tour is well worth it when in Dublin. It is a fascinating place for beer lovers or knowledge seekers to know how they manage to do this, the astonishing numbers behing the gallons produced, tons of barley taken into account and what not.</description>

      <description>One of Ireland&amp;rsquo;s most popular tourist destinations is the Cliffs of Moher; a natural beauty spanning around 14km in length and around 200m in height in the west of Ireland. If you are in Ireland, you can easily make a day trip from anywhere given the size of the country. I made a day trip from Dublin to Cliffs of Moher. While you can go in different ways such as car, bus or train/bus, or even cycle if you are adventurous, my friend and I opted to go with Finn McCools Tours booked via GetYourGuide.</description>

      <description>This post explains how to travel to Ireland without the need of any extra Irish visa but just a valid UK visa. There seems to be quite a big confusion about whether one can travel to the Republic of Ireland (not Northern Ireland) with a UK visa. A few friends of mine and people online also seemed misinformed about the same. However, a quick Google and some cases online reveal that indeed one can travel to Ireland with a UK visa and without the need of an extra Irish visa under the Short Term Visa Waiver Program.</description>

      <description>Is web scraping legal? A lot of people I met asked me this question; some had no idea that they could be breaking some rules if they scrape blindly because they assumed web scraping is always legal. However, the answer to this question is: it depends. Web scraping is not legal always.
You need to go to the website you want to scrape and look at a few things before concluding if you are breaking any rule.</description>

Hence, nn this tutorial, I will show how to automate excel reports using Python. The diagram below illustrates a typical excel report automation workflow.

In this blog post, we will how to go about making a day trip from Dubrovnik to Mostar.

      <description>Montenegro is a little beauty. It is easily the most underrated place I have visited in my travel history of 33 countries at the time of writing this article. Be it the taxi driver, or the hostel receptionist, or a random person on the street, or the lady at local restaurant, people in Montenegro are really friendly. Some of the people I came across are obsessed with Mahatma Gandhi. I went to this place with zero expectations and even thought if 5 days is a tad bit too much to get bored easily but I was wrong.</description>

I traveled to Montenegro without the need of any extra visa and on arriving at Podgorica airport, I was just stamped without any questions whatsoever. So, if you are a national of any country with a valid visa or residence permit from the United States of America, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland or any other Schengen countries, you do not need an extra visa to travel to Montenegro.</description>

While my friend and her husband took me around to the city areas, I also managed to crunch in a tour for desert safari in Dubai. The tour lasts for about 4-5 hours and is completely worth it if you want to experience something different instead of just seeing too many buildings and malls in downtown Dubai.</description>

      <description>Are you an ardent lover of both, beer and chicken? If yes, then this recipe is for you. Initially, I was amused by this idea when my Chinese flatmate was making it by mixing both together. Will chicken cooked with stew made out of beer really go well? However, later, I ended up falling in love with this dish. You are free to replace chicken with any other meat, or tofu or cottage cheese if you are a vegetarian.</description>

      <description>This is one of my all time favorite cake. As a kid, I had this cake during my birthdays as well. However, until I came to Germany, I did not know that the cake has its origin from Germany. Schwarzwald translated to Black Forest, an actual mountainous region in the south western part of Germany. Many people including myself would agree that the black forest cake in India differs from the one in Germany.</description>

I stumbled upon a dish called Shakshouka from Tunisia. The variants of Shakshouka are also found in other regions of North Africa and the Middle East. I confirmed the recipe with a Tunisian friend of mine as well.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was asked if I could share a particular dataset with some colleague of mine who wanted to test it in an R environment. Although this sounds straightforward, the problem was that the dataset from Pandas dataframe was stored in .pickle format. Now, at this stage, one possible solution was to load it in Python, save it as a CSV file and load the CSV file in an R environment.</description>

      <description>Pavlova is a dessert from New Zealand which my Aussie mate, Ryan, had taught me when we were flatmates in Munich. The dessert sounds very Russian and was indeed named after Anna Pavlova, a Russian ballet dancer, if sources are to be believed. Pavlova is crisp from outside but completely soft from inside. Here is the recipe which I have taken from my friend, Ryan.
Ingredients: 4 eggs Salt 225g caster sugar 1 teaspoon vinegar Half teaspoon vanilla essence 1 dessertspoon cornflour Whipped cream Fruits like strawberries, kiwi, passion fruits, raspberry, etc.</description>

In other words, the Saint Petersburg metro station art. I love trains, be it long distance ones across cities or short distance ones within a city. However, the metros in Saint Petersburg, along with other Russian or Soviet cities perhaps, have arts inculcated in the stations.</description>
