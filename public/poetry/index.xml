      <description>Think of it for a moment
We are all jugglers, aren&amp;rsquo;t we?
Always juggling problems throughout life
With no option at all to break free
There&amp;rsquo;s someone out there somewhere
Crippled with a massive debt
There&amp;rsquo;s someone else also somewhere
Reeling through the H1B visa bet
There&amp;rsquo;s someone out there somewhere
Recovering from a painful breakup
There&amp;rsquo;s someone out there somewhere
Struggling to assemble things for his startup
There&amp;rsquo;s someone out there with a smiling face</description>

      <description>For people who can read Hindi:
तरीका शायद गलत था पर इरादा सही
तरीका शायद गलत था पर इरादा सही
माफ़ कर दीजिये हमें मोहतरमा
यह रास्ता नहीं आज़माता तोह शायद आप आते ही नहीं
For people who cannot read Hindi:
Tareeqa shayad galat tha par irada sahi
Tareeqa shayad galat tha par irada sahi
Maaf kar dijiye humein mohotorma,
Yeh raasta nahi aazmata toh shayad aap aate hi nahi</description>

      <description>Give me a chance to not be a dunce.
Give me a chance to be with you once.
Give me a chance to rectify my mistake.
Give me a chance to put everything for you at stake.
Give me a chance to have your head on my shoulder.
Give me a chance to protect you like a soldier.
Give me a chance to cook for you when hungry.
Give me a chance to calm you down when angry.</description>

      <description>I finally reached Paris
I was missing someone dearly
I craved to hold her hands
And adore the 320 meter tall beauty
The city of love as it is popularly called
A few men knelt down on the ground
Expressing feelings to their lady love
Such was the scene all around
A few couples approched me
Requesting me to take their picture
The man passionately smooched his lady
I was their exclusive photographer</description>

      <description>Over an old rickety bridge
Where a canal connects with the sea
Stands a man in Venice
Who is dumbstruck by its beauty
Vintage buildings lined on the streets
Fresh flowers present everywhere
People waiting to board the boats
Aimlessly going here and there
Young couples making love
Old couples walking holding hands
The aroma of the Italian food
Along with performances by local bands
In midst of all these</description>
