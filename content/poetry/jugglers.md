<i>Think of it for a moment<br>
We are all jugglers, aren't we?<br>
Always juggling problems throughout life<br>
With no option at all to break free<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there somewhere<br>
Crippled with a massive debt<br>
There's someone else also somewhere<br>
Reeling through the H1B visa bet<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there somewhere<br>
Recovering from a painful breakup<br>
There's someone out there somewhere<br>
Struggling to assemble things for his startup<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there with a smiling face<br>
Attempting to cover up the suffering from depression<br>
There's someone out there who is insanely stressed<br>
About cracking the next important examination<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there somewhere<br>
Battling problems related to health<br>
There's someone out there somewhere<br>
Fighting to stay away from death<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there somewhere<br>
Trying to keep an eye on their loved one<br>
There's someone out there questioning themselves<br>
Because they are appreciated by none<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there struggling to get in touch<br>
With her family because of a government crackdown<br>
There's someone out there desperately trying<br>
Not to have any kind of breakdown<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there who built something<br>
Only to see it get abandoned some day<br>
There's someone out there having invested time<br>
On someone who was never meant to stay<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there hoping<br>
For a job that is well paid and stable<br>
There's someone out there struggling<br>
To get a promotion despite proving to be capable<br></i>

<i>There's someone out there somewhere<br>
Always living in a world of self-doubt<br>
There's someone out there asking himself<br>
If he is worthy enough to ask this other girl out<br></i>

<i>We all juggle multiple problems<br>
And many around get entertained by us<br>
Yet we continue to juggle these problems<br>
Without creating any kind of fuss<br></i>

<i>Think of it for a moment again<br>
We are all jugglers, aren't we?<br>
Always juggling problems throughout life<br>
With no option at all to break free<br></i>
