I may not be good
But I am not that bad.

I may look happy
But I can also be sad.

I may not be kind at times
But I am not always cruel.

I am not a cheat
But I can try to be loyal.

I may not be honest.
But I am not a liar.

I may not be a winner in life
But I am also not a loser.

I may not have been a good friend
But please do not consider me your enemy.

I may not console anyone
But I do show some sympathy.

I may not know how to show love
But I do not believe in hate.

I try to go after the impossible
But I am never late.

I may not be courageous
But I am not always gutless.

Things may be difficult for me
But I am not completely hopeless.

I never give up on things
Without giving it a try.

I treat every situation
Like a do-or-die.

Should I be worried about
How people feel I am?

But all that I know is
I am what I am.
