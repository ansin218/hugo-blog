<i>I finally reached Paris<br>
I was missing someone dearly<br>
I craved to hold her hands<br>
And adore the 320 meter tall beauty<br></i>

<i>The city of love as it is popularly called<br>
A few men knelt down on the ground<br>
Expressing feelings to their lady love<br>
Such was the scene all around<br></i>

<i>A few couples approched me<br>
Requesting me to take their picture<br>
The man passionately smooched his lady<br>
I was their exclusive photographer<br></i>

<i>I could have been him<br>
She could have been her<br>
We could have replicated<br>
The kiss from the couple earlier<br></i>

<i>The cool breeze on top of the Eiffel tower<br>
A warm cozy hug perfectly tight<br>
Flowers in hands and kiss on the lips<br>
It could have been a lovely romantic night<br></i>
