<i>Give me a chance to not be a dunce.<br>
Give me a chance to be with you once.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to rectify my mistake.<br>
Give me a chance to put everything for you at stake.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to have your head on my shoulder.<br>
Give me a chance to protect you like a soldier.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to cook for you when hungry.<br>
Give me a chance to calm you down when angry.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to wipe each of your tears.<br>
Give me a chance to make you fight all your fears.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to be with you twenty four seven.<br></i>
Give me a chance to make you feel in heaven.<br>

<i>Give me a chance to keep you happy always.<br>
Give me a chance to be there on your bad days.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to resolve a tangle.<br>
Give me a chance to view things from your angle.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to take up your responsibility.<br>
Give me a chance to show my loyalty.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to respect the rules to abide.<br>
Give me a chance to view the world from your side.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to work hard and try.<br>
Give me a chance to smile rather than cry.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to love what you like.<br>
Give me a chance to learn what you dislike.<br></i>

<i>Give me a chance to live for you.<br>
Give me a chance to die for you.</i>
