<i>Over an old rickety bridge<br>
Where a canal connects with the sea<br>
Stands a man in Venice<br>
Who is dumbstruck by its beauty<br></i>

<i>Vintage buildings lined on the streets<br>
Fresh flowers present everywhere<br>
People waiting to board the boats<br>
Aimlessly going here and there<br></i>

<i>Young couples making love<br>
Old couples walking holding hands<br>
The aroma of the Italian food<br>
Along with performances by local bands<br></i>

<i>In midst of all these<br>
Far far away is the moon<br>
Not entirely a part of this world<br>
Yet having the a reflection on the lagoon<br></i>

<i>To capture these picturesque scenes<br>
Lens of the camera would lose to the eyes<br>
Words of criticism from anybody<br>
Would be nothing but only lies<br></i>
