This is a two part tutorial series which will cover scraping a webpage with texts and images. To demonstrate this, we will scrape the list of megacities in our world along with their rankings and the country it belongs to. In addition, we will also scrape the relevant image of the city and store it locally in our system.

The link from which we will scrape is a Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity)

If you scroll down the page, you can come across a table looking like this:
