description: "Today I Learned (TIL) - Inspired by a subreddit."
---

Inspired by the subreddit [Today I Learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/), I made it a point to learn something every day and share it with the readers of my blog. Treat yourself to more knowledge at <a href="https://www.kanchalonka.com/til/" target="_blank">Kancha Lonka</a>, a blog run by my friend, Sukanya.

To keep the list short, only posts from current and previous month will be visible on this page.
