I love Turkish breakfast and brunches. One of the dishes my Turkish friends introduced to me was Cilbir (Çılbır in Turkish). I made this for the first time when I was stuck in Munich under lockdown due to COVID-19 and was craving for some Turkish dish. It turned out to be really good; worthy of sharing it on my blog too. Cilbir can easily be made with ingredients that we already have at home or available at the supermarket. It also does not take too much time to make this. So, here goes the recipe.

## Ingredients:

1. 1 cup yogurt / hung curd (preferable in room temperature)
2. 3-4 tbsp of butter
3. Chilli flakes
4. 1/2 tsp chilli powder
5. 1 garlic clove (less if you do not like strong garlic flavor)
6. 1/2 tsp cumin powder
7. Coriander / Parsley / Dill Leaves (optional, if you wish to use herbs)
8. 2 eggs
9. A few drops of white vinegar
10. A pinch of salt

## Preparation:

1. Prepare the yogurt base with grated garlic, a pinch of salt and some herbs of your choice.
2. Melt the butter in a pan and add a few chilli flakes, chilli powder and cumin powder. Feel free to add more spices or increase the hotness level to your liking.
3. Take another pot with simmering hot water and a few drops of white vinegar to it. Add the eggs to it and take it off in a few minutes when you feel the poached eggs are ready.
4. Take the yogurt base made in step 1 and spread it over a plate.
5. Add the poached eggs to this yogurt base.
6. Spread the chilli butter sauce over the poached eggs and the yogurt base. Add some herbs of your choice if you wish to garnish.

Enjoy Cilbir just as such or with bread of your choice.
