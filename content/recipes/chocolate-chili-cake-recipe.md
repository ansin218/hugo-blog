I baked this cake for <a href = "https://www.kanchalonka.com/" target = "_blank">my baking star friend, Sukanya</a>. Strangely, I had to bake this before her birthday as I had a flight to catch. The cake cutting celebration happened while I was away but I managed to get a small piece later and was fairly happy with the experiment and end result. Here is the chocolate chili cake recipe. Give it a shot for your loved one's next birthday.

## Ingredients:

1. 50g cacao powder
2. 7 tbsp boiled water
3. 2 packets vanilla sugar
4. 6 eggs
5. 600g flour
6. 180g sugar
7. 1 packet baking powder
8. 1/4 tsp salt
9. 375g butter
10. 200g chili chocolate bars
12. Strawberries / Cranberries / Other berries of your choice 
13. 100g milk chocolate
14. 200g whipped cream

## Preparation:

1. Prepare the cake tin (I used a 26cm one) and pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
2. Mix the cacao powder with boiled water and let it cool down.
3. Add eggs and the mixture from Step 2, and whisk them with a mixer or fork.
4. Take another bowl and mix all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, vanilla sugar and baking powder.
5. Add butter to half of the Cacao mix from Step 3 and the dry ingredients mix from Step 4 using a mixer slowly and increase the speed of the mixer gradually.
6. After a few minutes when the mixture is smooth, add the remaining other half of the cacao mix, and mix them well using a mixture.
7. Pour the mix into the cake tin and bake for 30-40 minutes. Use a toothpick to see if it has baked properly, and leave it longer in the oven if needed. Let it cool for a while after it has finished baking.
8. Create a mixture from the chili chocolate and whipped cream by heating them together. 
9. Once the cake has cooled, add the chili chocolate icing created in Step 8. 
10. Use a spatula to use some of the icing on the sides of the cake, this will act as a glue to stick the kit kat bars together.
