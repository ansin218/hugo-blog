If anyone knows me really well, they can assure you my love for Chinese food, especially the noodles with sauce made in Sichuan style. Be it restaurants or other friends, I pounce on the opportunity to ask for Sichuan food if given the option. After eating a lot of times at my friend's place and other restaurants, and watching many videos from other Chinese people on the internet, I tried to replicate one of my favorite Sichuan dishes - the dandan noodles as it is popularly known. From what I understand, there exists variations in the way the sauce is made. So, here goes the version of my spicy Sichuan dandan noodles recipe. I got all my ingredients either from a popular Chinese grocery market in Munich or from friends I know from China.

## Ingredients:

1. 350g of Sichuan noodles
2. 4 tbsp of sesame peanut butter paste
3. 2 tbsp of dark soya sauce
4. A few tbsp of Chinese chilli oil
5. 2 tbsp of chilli bean paste
6. A small piece of ginger finely chopped
7. 3-4 garlic cloves finely chopped
8. A few drops of sesame oil
9. 1-2 stems of spring onions
10. 1-2 tsp sesame seeds (optional)
11. A handful of crushed peanuts (optional)

## Instructions:

1. Mix the sesame peanut butter paste, dark soya sauce, chilli oil and chilli bean paste together, and stir it well. To this mix also add a handful of finely chopped spring onion greens.
2. Heat a pan with some sesame oil and chilli oil. To this, add the ginger and garlic, and stir it for a while. Feel free to add some meat or vegetables to this mix. I added some tofu, in my case, and later removed them and kept it aside. I like my tofu to be a bit flavored.
3. To this mix from Step 2, add the sauce you created in Step 1, and mix it well for a minute or two.
4. Boil your noodles as per instruction on the packet. In my case, I had to boil it for about 2-3 minutes only. Make sure they do not stick.
5. Serve the noodles with the sauce poured on it and top it with some spring onions, sesame seeds and crushed peanuts.

I created a no-meat version of the above recipe. The strength of the oil, peppercorns and sauce is a matter of personal preference. I tried to replicate it close to the way I had it at my friend's place and other Chinese restaurants in Munich, which, by large, is spicy. You may want to adjust these levels according to your own taste.
