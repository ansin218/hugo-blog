Tiramisu is my favorite Italian dessert. It is made with spoon biscuits known as savoiardi; really soft and has coffee flavored taste to it. I have had it multiple times in Italy and still continue to have it in Germany whenever I can. The crux of this Tiramisu recipe is from one of my Italian friends; a few other tiny modifications are from my side. Here is my attempt at surprising by making Tiramisu for some of my dear friends.

## Ingredients:

1. 400g savoiardi cookies (ladyfinger biscuits)
2. 6 fresh eggs
3. 500g mascarpone
4. 120g sugar
5. 100-150ml Espresso coffee
6. 100g Cocoa powder for topping
7. Vanilla essence or vanilla sugar (optional)
8. Drops of milk (optional)

## Preparation:

1. Separate the egg white from the egg yolk.
2. Whisk the yolk with half of the sugar and vanilla sugar until the cream is light and foamy.
3. Next, wisk the mascarpone for some time and maintain similar texture.
4. In another large bowl, beat the egg whites and remaining sugar until stiff and glossy peaks form.
5. Fold the egg whites into the mascarpone mixture.
6. Add some milk (just a few drops) to the coffee.
7. Put a thin layer of the mascarpone mixture at the bottom of 30x20cm container. Dip the savoiardi quickly into the coffee and arrange them in another layer. Do not soak the ladyfingers in the coffee for too long and break them. It may turn out to be really soggy later too.
8. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture on top of the savoiardi layer you just made.
9. Top with another layer of dipped savoiardi like Step 7.
10. Spread the remaining mascarpone mixture evenly on top of the layer with savoiardi biscuits.
11. Level the cream and refrigerate for a few hours before serving. I refrigerated it overnight (more than 12 hours) by wrapping a foil around it. You can poke a few holes to the foil to avoid too many water droplets forming inside.
12. Sprinkle with cocoa powder before serving.
