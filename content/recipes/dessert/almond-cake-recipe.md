I baked this cake for my friend on the occassion of her birthday. Given that the birthday fell on a weekday and I was running short of helping hands as well as time, I must admit the effort to make this cake was not much although the result in terms of the taste and aesthetics were pretty decent to celebrate a special occassion. You can give this recipe a shot if you are on a similar boat, or even otherwise. I would guess that it is a good cake for even a tea/coffee party.

## Ingredients:

### For the cake:

1. 400g flour
2. 150g sugar
3. 15g vanilla sugar
4. 10g baking powder
5. 5 tbsp crushed / powdered almonds
6. 200g melted butter
7. 6 medium-sized eggs
8. 250ml milk
9. 2ml almond essence
10. Berries of your choice (optional)
11. Powdered sugar (optional)

### For the frosting:

1. 120g butter
2. 300g cream cheese
3. 60g powdered sugar
4. 15g bourbon vanilla sugar

## Preparation:

### For the cake:

1. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl.
2. To this mix, add the eggs, milk, and melted butter.
3. Whisk them properly until you do not see any lumps.
4. Pour half of your mix to a 8-inch (20 cm) baking form. Bake the other half parallely or after the first one is done in case you have only one form.
5. Leave it in the oven for 30 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius. Check for consistency with a toothpick.

### For the frosting:

1. Add the butter and use the mixer to mix it for 2-3 minutes.
2. After 2-3 minutes, add the cream cheese and continue mixing for another 2-3 minutes on medium speed.
3. Finally, add the bourbon vanilla sugar and powdered sugar, and continue mixing for another 2-3 minutes.
4. It should look rich and creamy. Let it settle for 20-30 minutes in the fridge if you want it to be a bit more thick.
5. Finally, add the cream cheese frosting to the cake, including some between the two layers. Decorate with some berries of your choice. Sprinkle extra powdered sugar or crushed almonds if you wish to.

Enjoy the cake with some nice tea or coffee.
