When I was a kid, having the famous German black forest cake for my birthday was the norm. After I landed in Munich, Germany, I was only looking for this cake everywhere. However, I could not find it and settled for this thing called Donauwelle. It translates to Danube wave; the Danube is a river flowing through different parts of Europe. It has been five years since I had Donauwelle for the first time and it is my favourite cake now; more than the black forest cake. I asked many Germans to bake me this and share the recipe. The donauwelle recipe I am sharing below is the best one I have from one of my colleagues.

## Ingredients:

### For the cake:

1. 400g flour
2. 300ml sunflower oil
3. 100g brown sugar
4. 75g white sugar
5. 2 tsp baking soda
6. 300g grated carrots
7. 4 large-sized eggs
8. 100g raisins (optional)
9. 16g orange zest (optional)
10. 2 tsp cinnamon powder
11. 1 tsp nutmeg powder (optional)
12. 1 tsp ginger powder (optional)
13. 1 tsp cardamom powder (optional)

### For the frosting:

1. 70g butter
2. 175g cream cheese
3. 40g powdered sugar
4. 8g bourbon vanilla sugar

## Preparation:

### For the cake:

1. Whisk the sugar, oil and eggs in a bowl for 4-5 minutes. Check if the sugar has dissolved completely. Continue for some more time if it has not.
2. Mix all the other remaining dry ingredients such as the flour, the spices, the orange zest and the baking soda together.
3. Add the dry ingredients slowly to the mix from step 1.
4. To the mix from step 3, add the grated carrots and raisins.
5. Transfer all the mix to the tin and bake it at 170 degrees Celsius for about 45 minutes or until done. To check if the cake is done, use a toothpick or a spaghetti and poke it to different parts of the cake, if it comes out clean, you can now take it out.

### For the frosting:

1. Add the butter and use the mixer to mix it for 2-3 minutes.
2. After 2-3 minutes, add the cream cheese and continue mixing for another minute or two on medium speed.
3. Finally, add the bourbon vanilla sugar and powdered sugar and continue mixing for another 2-3 minutes.
4. It should look rich and creamy. Let it settle for 20-30 minutes in the fridge if you want it to be a bit more thick.
5. Finally, add the cream cheese frosting to the cake, and decorate with some crushed nuts, and real carrots as shown in the picture.
