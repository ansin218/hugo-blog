One Friday afternoon I was craving for some cake to have with my tea and decided to make this. I decided to improve this on the fly by adding some cardamom powder with some toppings of almonds and pistachios. So, here is a simple cardamom cake recipe with toppings of almonds and pistachios prepared in less than 10 minutes and baked in 30 minutes.
