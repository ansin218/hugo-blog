One of my good friends, Elena, is always excited for her birthday and in 2018, she asked me to bake her a kit kat cake. I used my favorite chocolate recipe from my baking star friend, Aysun. For the decoration part, <a href = "https://www.kanchalonka.com/" target = "_blank">my other baking star friend, Sukanya</a> helped me. We managed to accomplish something finally. Here is the kit kat cake recipe below. Give it a shot for your loved one's next birthday.

## Ingredients:

1. 50g cacao powder
2. 7 tbsp boiled water
3. 2 packets vanilla sugar
4. 6 eggs
5. 600g flour
6. 180g sugar
7. 1 packet baking powder
8. 1/4 tsp salt
9. 375g butter
10. A few kitkat bars (I needed at least 50)
12. Strawberries / M&M's / Gems (Depending on your choice, I added strawberries)
13. 100g milk chocolate
14. 200g whipped cream

## Preparation:

1. Prepare the cake tin (I used a 26cm one) and pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
2. Mix the cacao powder with boiled water and let it cool down.
3. Add eggs and the mixture from Step 2, and whisk them with a mixer or fork.
4. Take another bowl and mix all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, vanilla sugar and baking powder.
5. Add butter to half of the Cacao mix from Step 3 and the dry ingredients mix from Step 4 using a mixer slowly and increase the speed of the mixer gradually.
6. After a few minutes when the mixture is smooth, add the remaining other half of the cacao mix, and mix them well using a mixture.
7. Pour the mix into the cake tin and bake for 30-40 minutes. Use a toothpick to see if it has baked properly, and leave it longer in the oven if needed. Let it cool for a while after it has finished baking.
8. Create a mixture from the milk chocolate and whipped cream by heating them together.
9. Once the cake has cooled, add the milk chocolate icing created in Step 8. 
10. Use a spatula to use some of the icing on the sides of the cake, this will act as a glue to stick the kit kat bars together.
11. Stick the kit kat bars one by one all around the cake. Keep it glued by using a ribbon if possible.
12. Fill the cake inside with other things like strawberries, other berries, M&M's or gems.
