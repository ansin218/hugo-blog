I baked this cake along with my friend, <a href = "https://www.kanchalonka.com/" target = "_blank">Sukanya</a> for our friend, <a href = "https://nudges.netlify.app/post/" target = "_blank">Phyllis</a>. We followed a mix of different recipes and fine tuned it to our requirements; especially the sweetness level because we do not boast of a great sweet tooth. You can also adjust the recipe below to get rid of the lemon part completely or increase the strength if you like the taste of it like I do. Anyway, here goes the recipe.

## Ingredients:

### For the cake:

1. 140g flour
2. 250g blueberries (defrost and drain the berries if using frozen ones)
3. 8g vanilla sugar
4. 2 eggs
5. 80g sugar
6. A pinch of cinnamon powder
7. 15g baking powder
8. 6g lemon zest
9. 120g butter
10. 1 tbsp lemon juice

### For the frosting:

1. 70g butter
2. 175g cream cheese
3. 40g powdered sugar
4. 8g vanilla sugar

## Preparation:

### For the cake:

1. Prepare the cake tin (I used an 8 inch one) and pre-heat the oven to 175 degrees Celsius.
2. Mix the following dry ingredients together in a bowl - flour, baking powder, vanilla sugar, cinnamon powder
3. In another bowl, add the butter and use the electric mixer to mix it for 2-3 minutes on medium speed.
4. To the mix from Step 3, gradually add the following sequentially while continuing to mix - sugar, eggs, the mix from Step 2, lemon zest and lemon juice.
5. Transfer the mix from Step 4 into a baking tin and just add the blueberries on the top; it will settle and mix gradually once it bakes.
6. After 40-45 minutes, check if the cake is ready by using a toothpick to see if it comes out clean. Let it cool for a while.

The cake is already ready to eat at this stage. To continue making the cream cheese frosting and make it more presentable, follow the steps below.

### For the frosting:

1. Add the butter and use the mixer to mix it for 2-3 minutes.
2. After 2-3 minutes, add the cream cheese and continue mixing for another minute or two on medium speed.
3. Finally, add the vanilla sugar and powdered sugar and continue mixing for another 2-3 minutes.
4. It should look rich and creamy. Let it settle for 20-30 minutes in the fridge if you want it to be a bit more thick.
5. Finally, add the cream cheese frosting to the cake, and decorate with more blueberries and other berries, flowers or herbs of your choice.

I do not know what flowers they are exactly, unfortunately. I do not even know if they are eatable, most likely not. None of us ate the flowers. We bought them only for presentation purpose from a supermarket for about 2 Euros (150 INR).
