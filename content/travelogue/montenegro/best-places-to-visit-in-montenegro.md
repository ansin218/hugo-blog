Montenegro is a little beauty. It is easily the most underrated place I have visited in my travel history of 33 countries at the time of writing this article. Be it the taxi driver, or the hostel receptionist, or a random person on the street, or the lady at local restaurant, people in Montenegro are really friendly. Some of the people I came across are obsessed with Mahatma Gandhi. I went to this place with zero expectations and even thought if 5 days is a tad bit too much to get bored easily but I was wrong. I went there during the month of April when the weather was neither too cold nor too hot, and thankfully, not too many tourists but all the shops being opened. In future, even if I run out of places to see, I would gladly go back to Montenegro, Kotor or Budva may be, to just relax and spend a few days doing nothing. I may have missed out on a few places but I tried to make most of my time visiting quite a few places during my five days there. I will now list some of the best places to visit in Montenegro.

## Kotor

My friend and I stayed chose Kotor as our base and we had no regrets. This was the view from our apartment located at the Skaljari area, about 15 minute walk from the old town.

The old town itself is a nice area to walk around with many restaurants, small passages, markets and other shops. Besides this, Kotor has its own fortress, Kotor Fortress. The hike starts off easily but gets dangerous as you go higher. However, after a few meters you should get this wonderful view; the hike until here is very much doable even for beginners; I consider myself one.

Get the map before you begin your hike to know which paths can be dangerous. The guy at the ticket counter was really sweet. He did not have money to return so he just asked to go for free. The actual cost was somewhere close to 7 Euros.

## Budva

An hour away from Kotor is another place called Budva. Budva, from what I heard, is the fancier, richer and more touristic version of Kotor. Sources claim the Russians heavily invested and helped develop this place. Having said that, Budva is really beautiful as well. It has its own castle. I could not capture everything in the picture below but we saw a couple clicking wedding photographs, listening to someone playing the guitar, the church bells ringing, the sun setting in, and the sound of the water from the Adriatic coast; what a lovely feeling.

## Perast

When you are at Kotor, a tour of the Boka Bay is highly recommended. A part of the tour takes you through this wonderful region of Perast.

The boat also stops at Lady of the Rocks. While I cannot recollect the exact history, I got to know the localites visit this place every year to throw some rocks and come back as a ritual.

The boat takes you later towards the blue sea caves. This was another fascinating place to visit. Look how blue the water looks without any filter. You even see the reflection on the cave itself.

## Cetinje

## Ostrog Monastery

## Virpazar
