This post explains how to travel to Romania with a Schengen visa or residence permit. I am an Indian passport holder with a residence permit from Germany; at the time of traveling to Romania I had an Aufenthaltstitel (student residence permit) from Germany. I traveled to Romania without the need of any extra visa and arriving at the Bucharest airport. I was only asked about the purpose of my trip and the length of my stay at Romania at the immigration. So, if you are a national of any country with a valid visa or residence permit from Croatia, Cyprus, Bulgaria or any other Schengen countries, you do not need an extra visa to travel to Romania.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania website states the following:

> Holders of Schengen visas with two or multiple entries, national visas or residence permits issued by Schengen Member States. Starting July 11, 2014, in keeping with the provisions of Decision No 565/2014/EU, Romania acknowledges as being equivalent to its own national visas, for transit and for stays up to 90 days per period of 180 days the following:

> - The two or multiple entry short-stay visa issued by a Schengen member state;

> - The limited territorial validity visa issued by a Schengen member state;

> - The short-stay visa issued by Bulgaria, Cyprus or Croatia;

> - The long-stay visa issued by a Schengen member state;

> - The long-stay visa issued by Bulgaria, Cyprus or Croatia;

> - The residence permit issued by a Schengen member state;

> - The residence permit issued by Bulgaria, Cyprus or Croatia

> - The long-term resident's EC residence permit (the validity of which is of 5 years or more) issued by a member state of the European Union.

> Attention! The number of entries as well as the right of stay established as per the Schengen visas must not have been exhausted. The right of stay on the territory of Romania shall not exceed the right of stay granted as per the visas/residence permits issued by the Schengen Member States.
