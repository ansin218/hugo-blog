This post explains how to travel to Montenegro with Schengen visa or residence permit. I am an Indian passport holder with a residence permit from Germany; at the time of traveling to Montenegro I had an EU Blue Card/Aufenthaltstitel from Germany. I traveled to Montenegro without the need of any extra visa and on arriving at Podgorica airport, I was just stamped without any questions whatsoever. So, if you are a national of any country with a valid visa or residence permit from the United States of America, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland or any other Schengen countries, you do not need an extra visa to travel to Montenegro.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Montenegro website states the following:

> Holders of travel documents containing a valid Schengen visa, a valid visa of the United States of America, United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, or a permission to stay in these countries, may enter and stay, or pass through the territory of Montenegro up to 30 days, and not longer than the expiry of visa, if the period of validity of the visa is less than 30 days. <br>

> Holders of travel documents issued by the European Union Member States or the United States of America, Kingdom of Norway, Republic of Ireland, Swiss Confederation, Canada, Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and Japan based on the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) or Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons (1954), as well as Travel Documents for Foreigners may enter, pass through the territory of and stay in Montenegro up to 30 days without a visa.
