This post explains how to travel to Croatia with Schengen visa or residence permit. I am an Indian passport holder with a residence permit from Germany; at the time of traveling to Croatia I had an EU Blue Card/Aufenthaltstitel from Germany and my friend with whom I had traveled had a student visa from Germany. I traveled to Croatia without the need of any extra visa and entered via the land border between Montenegro and Croatia. All the buses and cars were being stopped and each passenger was being exmained on the Croatian side.  I also entered Crotia from the Bosnian side later but without any checking or questions as we were part of a group tour. So, if you are a national of any country with a valid visa or residence permit from any of the Schengen countries, Bulgaria, Romania or Cyprus, you do not need an extra visa to travel to Croatia.

The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Croatia states the following:

> All third-country nationals who are holders of valid Schengen documents, as well as national visas and residence permits of Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Romania do not require an additional (Croatian) visa for Croatia.<br>
Third-country nationals who are holders of:<br>

> - uniform visa C for two or multiple entries, valid for all Schengen Area Member States;

> - visa with limited territorial validity (LTV visa), for two or multiple entries, issued to the holder of a travel document that is not recognised by one or more, but not all of the Schengen Area Member States, and which is valid for the territory of the Member States recognising the travel document;

> - long-stay visa D for stays exceeding three months, issued by one of the Schengen Area Member State;

> - residence permit issued by one of the Schengen Area Member State;

> - national visas for two or multiple entries and residence permits of Bulgaria, listed in Annex I of the Decision No 565/2014/EU;

> - national visas for two or multiple entries and residence permits of Cyprus, listed in Annex III of the Decision No 565/2014/EU;

> - national visas for two or multiple entries and residence permits of Romania, listed in Annex IV of the Decision No 565/2014/EU;<br>
do not require a visa for transit or intended stays in the territory of Croatia not exceeding 90 days in any 180-day period.
