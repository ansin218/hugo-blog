This post explains how to travel to Ireland without the need of any extra Irish visa but just a valid UK visa. There seems to be quite a big confusion about whether one can travel to the Republic of Ireland (not Northern Ireland) with a UK visa. A few friends of mine and people online also seemed misinformed about the same. However, a quick Google and some cases online reveal that indeed one can travel to Ireland with a UK visa and without the need of an extra Irish visa under the [Short Term Visa Waiver Program](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Irish+Short+Stay+Visa+Waiver+Programme). So, the good news is one can travel to Ireland with UK visa under certain conditions. They are:

- You need to have a valid C type short term UK visa
- You should have obtained entry to the United Kingdom first
- Your trip to Ireland must end before the UK visa ends
- You must belong to one of the following nationalities: Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Russian Federation, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, India, Kazakhstan, China, Thailand, Uzbekistan

Now I will clarify some of the doubts many people had or seem to be having below.

### Can I directly land in the Republic of Ireland with an unused UK visa?

No. You need to first get the entry permission from an immigration officer in the United Kingdom.

### Can I directly land in the Republic of Ireland with a used UK visa from the past which is valid?

Yes. I used my UK visa for a trip to London in July 2019. I flew directly to Dublin from Munich and was stamped by an immigration officer in the Republic of Ireland.

### Do I need to enter the Republic of Ireland only via the United Kingdom?

No. You can also fly directly to the Republic of Ireland if you have a used and valid UK visa.

### Can I use a UK visa that was issued somewhere but not my home country?

Yes. My UK visa was issued in Germany and I am an Indian national. 

### I am an Indian / Chinese national and have no BIVS stamp. Can I still travel to the Republic of Ireland with my UK visa?

Yes, if it fits the conditions mentioned on the website. I did not have a BIVS stamp on my UK visa either. I just had a UK visa issued in Germany that was valid and used once at the time of visiting Republic of Ireland.
