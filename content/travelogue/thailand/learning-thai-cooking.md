I sat down on the floor wincing and gasping for breath after an intense session training for kickboxing. I noticed a lady with a bag of fresh herbs walking towards the kitchen. Despite the excruciating pain I was experiencing, I got back on my feet immediately and followed her.

I knocked on the door and politely asked, “Hello! Are you going to cook something?”

With a strong Thai accent, she stuttered, “Yes!”, and continued, “After fifteen minutes. You want something?”

“I love cooking. Can you please teach me to cook Thai food?”, I requested.

“Yes! Yes!”, she exclaimed joyfully with a grin on her face.

I decided to quickly freshen up and get a shower. After fifteen minutes, I was back in the kitchen again. She was meticulously chopping the vegetables and preparing all the other ingredients.

Interrupting her I asked, “What are you cooking today?” and she answered, “Kai Yat Sai”

I asked her again, “Sorry, what?” and this time she stressed slowly, “Kaaai-Yat-Saaai”

I kept repeating it a few times to get it right; to say it just like the locals do. She corrected me each time and finally she said, “Yes! Yes! Correct!”

A very close friend of mine in Munich loves Thai food. Hence, I seeked permission from the lady to make videos for my friend. She gladly obliged. I was curious to know what exactly Kai Yat Sai was and started watching her make it while simultaneously recording it for my friend. The end product turned out to be a Thai style omelette stuffed with vegetables and herbs. The lady then turned to me, handed me the wok, and ordered, “You cook next!”

I was excited but also nervous; excited to learn something new but nervous to not mess it up because the food had to be served to other students at the kickboxing camp. I paid great attention to her instructions and successfully made my first Kai Yat Sai.

I thanked her and asked, “Can you please teach me Pad Thai? I love Pad Thai!” and with exuberance she replied, “Yes! Yes! Tomorrow!”

The kickboxing session the next day was far more gruelling but it did not stop me from going to the kitchen. I was all prepared to learn and cook Pad Thai. The kitchen had everything ready: noodles soaked in warm water, a plethora of sauces, prawns cleaned, chicken diced into small pieces, eggs whisked, herbs chopped, lemon sliced, peanuts crushes and a flaming hot wok waiting for us to begin the proceedings.

At one point when we had to add the chilli paste, she asked, “You like spicy food?” and I happily said, “Yes! I come from India and I can eat very spicy food.”

She continued, “We had four Indians. They could not handle my chilli paste. Try my chilli paste.”

I tried her chilli paste. My eyes turned red and my tongue was set on fire instantly. I was close to tears. She laughed out loud, incremented her count, and said, “Five Indians!”

She continued giving me directions to finish making Pad Thai. After a few minutes, I was done and we arranged the noodles on different plates garnishing it with chopped coriander leaves, sliced lemon and crushed peanuts. It looked delectable, smelled aromatic and tasted delicious. We were pleased with the way it turned out.A speciality of Pad Thai is that it is a dish cooked with a fine balance of ingredients that are sweet, sour, spicy and salty.

It was finally time for me to head to the airport. I asked the lady while leaving if she had any small jars for me to take some of her homemade pastes and sauces for my friend. She offered me big jars but I did not have any space in my bag. I thanked her nevertheless for teaching me to cook Thai food at the kickboxing camp. My purpose of visiting Bangkok was to only learn Thai kickboxing. However, thanks to that lady, I also learnt how to make Thai food.
