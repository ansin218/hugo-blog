There are three ways to get the Cambodian visa: online, on arrival or by visiting your nearest Cambodian embassy/consulate. I chose the first option for multiple reasons: not wasting further pages on my passport as I have only a few to spare, I did not want to step out of home to go to the consulate or stand in a long queue after reaching Cambodia to apply for my visa on arrival. The procedure to apply the Cambodian eVisa is by far the easiest I have ever come across.

## Steps:

1. Head to: <a href = "https://www.evisa.gov.kh/" target = "_blank">https://www.evisa.gov.kh/</a><br>
2. Fill up the form on the website. Their system is pretty nice as it automatically detects most of the information correctly when you give the picture of your passport details. You may want to give a latest picture (I did) if your passport photograph is old or not clear.
3. Go through all the information once again, make the payment and wait for 2-3 working days as mentioned on their website. My Cambodian eVisa came in one day.
4. Carry two copies when you visit Cambodia; give one while entering and one while leaving the country.

I visited Siem Reap in January 2020. You can read my blog on <a href = "https://www.ankuroh.com/travelogue/cambodia/things-to-do-in-siem-reap-cambodia/" target = "_blank">things to do in Siem Reap</a> if you plan to visit the same too.
