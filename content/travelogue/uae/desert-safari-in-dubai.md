I was on my way to Chennai from Munich and I took a long layover in Dubai to catch up with an old friend of mine and explore the city. While my friend and her husband took me around to the city areas, I also managed to crunch in a tour for desert safari in Dubai. The tour lasts for about 4-5 hours and is completely worth it if you want to experience something different instead of just seeing too many buildings and malls in downtown Dubai. Most of the things in this tour were new to me and hence, I was super excited. My friend managed to book a tour for me and I just got dropped and picked up by the tour guides at Dragon Mall. I paid them in cash, about 50 AED, directly. There are way too many agencies and companies offering these tours, some of which you can even find online.

## Dune Bashing

After reaching the desert area of the city, which took almost an hour from the city itself, you are asked to get into a 4WD Land Cruiser. If you are doing this trip alone, you are likely to be fit into with other groups. Dune bashing is an adventurous experience of its own kind. For about 10-15 minutes, the driver speeds the car through the ups and downs of the desert. It can be insanely scary at certain points where you feel your car may crash or fall somewhere or topple any moment. The drivers are experienced but there are [reports of tragedies](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/general/going-on-a-desert-safari-to-death) as well. Avoid sitting next to the driver for a less scary or more adrenalin rush experience. Be careful as to how much you eat before the drive begins else throwing up cannot be ruled out. I am someone who gets scared by such things a bit easily and hence I had no guts to make a video myself. Here is a video from someone else as to how dune bashing can be.

## Camel Ride

After 10-15 minutes of dune bashing, you are dropped at a point where you can do so many things. One of them is to take a camel ride. You can find a few camels around. Talk to the person in-charge for a camel ride and wait for your chance to come.

## Picture With Falcon

The falcon is one of the national symbols of the UAE and is deeply rooted in the Emirati culture. Some tours let you take a picture with the falcon while some say that you may have to pay the person a few extra Dirhams. The man there asked me 20 AED for a picture and 10 AED for the traditional cloth to wear on my head. However, I bargained and closed the deal overall for just 10 AED. Yes, you can negotiate!

## Sunset

You are free to walk around to any part of the desert but the onus is on you to get to your initial point safely. I ventured to walk around aimlessly a bit too far from the crowd to soak into the beauty of desert sunset; something I never witnessed before. It was really beautiful.

## Ethnic Arab Dress

Another fun thing to do is to try the ethnic Emirati outfit. People got to wear this for free and click some pictures. I managed to take one as well. Yes, I look funny.
