From having good food to checking out some historical places, there are lots of things to do in Hanoi, Vietnam. However, with limited time and specific interest, I managed to do only some of them which I am listing below.

## Visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum

Located at Ba Dinh Square, the mausoleum serves as the resting place of the famous Vietnamese leader, Ho Chi Minh. The local Vietnamese people also refer to him as Bác Hồ  or Uncle Ho. It is free to enter but has limited opening times.

## Visit the Ho Chi Minh Museum

Next to the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, you can find the Ho Chi Minh museum. If you have no idea or have limited knowledge about him, this place is a good start to know more. Tickets cost 40,000 VND (1.5 EUR / 2 USD) for adults.

## Checkout the train street

This is one of the things that Hanoi is famous for. In midst of the maddening traffic and life right next to tracks, you can see the train pass at certain times of the day. There can be guards refusing you to venture across the post. Apart from negotiating, going to the cafes or food places along the tracks can be another option to relax alongside the tracks.

## Visit the B52 Museum

For all the people boasting of knowledge related to wars and military equipments, this place can be another decent short visit. You can find the wreckage of the B52 aircraft that was shot down by the Vietnamese folks. The museum is free and the wreckages are all placed outside. You will witness the mammoth structure here.

## Old Propaganda Posters Shop

This was shop was located right next to my hotel. You can find different kinds of posters, stickers and postcards related to propaganda in Vietnam from different points of their historical timeline.

## Dine at the Old Quarter

The old quarter in Hanoi is a bustling world in itself. Motorcycles speeding past you, diners occupying bulk of the roads, many people screaming, laughing, talking and running around, this place has a lovely vibe. You will either love it or hate it; I loved it. This was my favorite part of Vietnam. My hotel was here. Staying in this area and seeing how this place burts into life once the sun sets in is magical.
